# Decentralized Voting System

This project is a Decentralized Voting System that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting through blockchain technology.
It consists of a React frontend and an Express/Node.js backend that work together to allow users to cast their votes safely.

<p>ðŸš¨ $${\color{red}Attention}$$ This project  works well in the local machine and uses gas money when voting thus it try ro simulate the transaction through Ganache. </p>

## Overview
This project will try to tackle some of the problems that can be faced during Voting online.
- Security: The system is built to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that only eligible voters can participate and preventing tampering with vote records.
- Transparency: The blockchainâ€™s public ledger allows for transparency, enabling anyone to verify the results without compromising voter privacy.
- Decentralization: By using a decentralized network, the system removes the need for a central authority, reducing the risk of corruption or manipulation.
- User-Friendly Interface: The system includes a React-based frontend to provide an intuitive and accessible voting experience
